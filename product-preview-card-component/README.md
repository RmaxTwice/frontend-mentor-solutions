## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to use media queries to change the flexbox direction to achieve the design transition from mobile to desktop.
- How to use custom CSS properties (or variables).
- How useful are the `text-transform`, `line-height` and `letter-spacing` properties to attract the attention of the user to a particular text element.
- How to use semantic HTML5 elements(tags) to better define the structure of the document, e.g. `<article>`, `<main>` and `<figure>`


### Continued development

Need to gain more experience styling images to avoid some fitting problems with their containers.
Also, need to figure out why the font weights look different than the expected design. This happens even while using the styles defined in the [style-guide](./style-guide.md).

### Useful resources

- [Color Picker Tool](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool) - This helped me choose the button color for hover and active states.
