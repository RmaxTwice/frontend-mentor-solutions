## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a refreshment of the following concepts: Importing google fonts, Flexbox and rem units usage.

Nothing too complicated, mobile design was implemented first and the desktop implementation was achieved with a simple `max-width: 300px` rule for the card element.


### Continued development

Replicating the box shadow was the most annoying part, along with the font boldness not looking exactly like the design despite using the font weight indicated in the style guide (700)


### Useful resources

- [Box Shadow Generator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Backgrounds_and_Borders/Box-shadow_generator) - This helped me get as close as my eyes allow me to the design box shadow in a really fast and interactive way.
